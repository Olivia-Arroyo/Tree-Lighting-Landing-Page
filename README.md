# Tree-Lighting-Landing-Page

This project is a **Tree Lighting Ceremony landing page** that showcases key event details, including a countdown timer, RSVP form, and gallery of past events. It uses **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** (with Moment.js) to display a dynamic countdown until the event. The page is designed to be festive, mobile-friendly, and easily customizable for future event announcements.
